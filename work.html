        <div class="wsp">Come learn the famous gāyatrī mantraḥ - a solar chant for clarity and strength! In addition to the saṁhitā theme, we will also chant other variations called krama and jaṭā recitations, which are beautiful, interesting, and focusing. Ancient yoga science points to the healing and transformational power of sound. Now more and more we see evidence in modern science that certain patterns of vibration and sound do indeed have the capacity to create coherence in the human system. One of the most powerful aspects of chanting is that it integrates the sensory-motor loop of our nervous system. You are invited to experience directly how chanting can change your state of mind and emotions in a positive direction.</div>
